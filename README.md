# The Harvis AI Project
### Quick Start (Local Development)

Harvis runs the same Docker Compose stack on Ubuntu and Windows. The host bootstrap is different: Ubuntu uses Bash; native Windows uses PowerShell with Docker Desktop's Linux containers. Kubernetes/k3s deployment remains Linux-only.

**Ubuntu 22.04/24.04**

Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose from [Docker's Ubuntu instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), then use the Bash installer below.

**Windows 11 (native host)**

Install Docker Desktop, enable its WSL 2 integration, install the current NVIDIA Windows driver for a GPU machine, and install/start Ollama or another OpenAI-compatible local model server. From PowerShell in this repository, run:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -CheckOnly
.\install.ps1 -VerifyGpu
.\install.ps1 -Yes
```

`-VerifyGpu` is optional for a CPU-only host. The PowerShell installer automatically maps a model server listening on Windows `localhost` to Docker Desktop's `host.docker.internal`; do not pass `http://localhost:11434` as the LLM URL. To supply one explicitly, use:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Yes -LlmUrl http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

For a dedicated 4090 host, the practical order is: Windows NVIDIA driver → Docker Desktop/WSL 2 → `install.ps1 -VerifyGpu` → Ollama and models → `install.ps1 -Yes`.

### Installation & Usage

## 1.  **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Harvis
```
<img width="760" height="163" alt="clone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ddf838-296e-4ecd-bb91-e34414f0b930" />
    
## 2.  **Environment variables (only for a manual setup):**
Both installers create the top-level `.env` and generate missing secrets. To configure it yourself before starting the stack, copy the backend example file with your OS's normal file command, then create the top-level `.env` values `docker-compose.yaml` reads:

```bash
    # Ubuntu
    cp python_back_end/.env.example python_back_end/.env
    # top-level .env (docker-compose reads these):
    JWT_SECRET=<a-long-random-secret>       # REQUIRED — compose fails to start without it
    MOONSHOT_API_KEY=<kimi-key>             # optional — cloud planner/writer (Kimi K2.5)
    OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token>          # optional — OpenClaw agent runtime
```

```powershell
# Windows equivalent
Copy-Item python_back_end/.env.example python_back_end/.env
```
See `docker-compose.yaml` for the full list of variables.

## 3.  **Run the installer:**
On **Ubuntu**, use `./install.sh`:

There is nothing to choose. Harvis ships the workspace — UI, API, routing, auth, ONNX speech,
embeddings — and needs **no GPU of its own**, so the old nvidia/amd/cpu question is gone. The
installer looks for a model server you already run, generates the secrets `.env` needs, creates the
docker network, and launches the stack:

```bash
    ./install.sh          # detects a local model server, then installs
    ./install.sh --yes    # same, non-interactive
```

On **native Windows**, use `./install.ps1 -Yes` after the Docker Desktop and GPU preflight shown above. It performs the same `.env`, network, database-password, build, and health checks, while using Docker Desktop's `host.docker.internal` bridge for a Windows-hosted model server.

It probes this machine for an OpenAI-compatible server and uses the first one it finds:

| Port | Server |
|---|---|
| 11434 | Ollama |
| 1234 | LM Studio |
| 8080 | llama.cpp |
| 8000 | vLLM |

Point it somewhere else with `./install.sh --llm-url http://host.docker.internal:11434` — note that
`localhost` inside a container means *the container*, so use `host.docker.internal` or a LAN IP for a
server on your own machine. Found or not, the stack starts either way: with no server running, Harvis
comes up and reports that no model provider is connected, and you can attach one from Settings later.

**Apple Silicon (M-series):** Docker on macOS can't reach the Mac GPU, so run **Ollama natively** for
Metal acceleration — the installer will find it on 11434 like any other host server.

<details><summary>Manual / advanced (skip the installer)</summary>

```bash
    docker network create ollama-n8n-network    # once (external network)
    docker compose up --build -d
```
`JWT_SECRET` must be set in `.env` for this to start. Set `HARVIS_LLM_BASE_URL` to your model
server; every service resolves against it, falling back to `OLLAMA_URL` and then to
`http://host.docker.internal:11434`.
</details>

## 4.  **Access the application:**
Open **`http://localhost:9000/harvis/`** — Nginx serves the web UI and proxies all `/api/*` calls to the
backend. Do **not** call the backend on `:8000` directly from the browser (CORS). The UI is the
Hermes desktop app built from `front_end/hermes-desktop-ui/`; the first visit shows its sign-in
screen, and the first account made on a fresh install is the admin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (v2 / the `docker compose` plugin).
- A GPU is **optional** — `./install.sh` supports **nvidia**, **amd** (ROCm), or **cpu**. Only the
  `nvidia` backend needs an NVIDIA GPU + nvidia-container-toolkit; `cpu` runs anywhere. See the
  "Choose your backend" section above.
- `ffmpeg` for audio (voice) features.


## n8n Workflow Automation API

Harvis AI includes a sophisticated AI-powered n8n workflow automation system that interprets natural language requests and automatically generates corresponding n8n workflows.

### Architecture Overview

The n8n automation system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **AI Analysis Engine** - Uses Ollama/Mistral to parse natural language requests
2. **Workflow Builder** - Constructs n8n-compatible workflow configurations
3. **n8n Client** - Manages communication with n8n REST API
4. **Database Storage** - Tracks created workflows and automation history
5. **Template System** - Provides pre-built workflow templates for common tasks

### API Endpoints

#### Core Automation Endpoints

- **`POST /api/n8n/automate`** - Create workflow from natural language prompt
- **`POST /api/n8n/workflow`** - Create workflow from predefined template
- **`GET /api/n8n/workflows`** - List user's created workflows
- **`GET /api/n8n/templates`** - List available workflow templates
- **`POST /api/n8n/workflow/{id}/execute`** - Execute workflow manually
- **`GET /api/n8n/workflow/{id}/executions`** - Get workflow execution history
- **`GET /api/n8n/history`** - Get user's automation request history
- **`GET /api/n8n/health`** - Check system health and connectivity

#### Frontend Proxy Endpoints

- **`POST /api/n8n-automation`** - Next.js proxy route for browser access

### Key Libraries and Dependencies

#### Backend (Python)
- **`requests`** - HTTP client for n8n API communication
- **`pydantic`** - Data validation and serialization
- **`asyncpg`** - PostgreSQL async database driver
- **`fastapi`** - API framework
- **`ollama`** - AI model integration

#### Frontend (TypeScript)
- **`next.js`** - React framework for API routes
- **`react`** - UI components and state management

### How It Works

#### 1. Natural Language Processing
```python
# User input: "Every 5 minutes, check if google.com is up. If not, send Discord message"
async def _analyze_user_prompt(prompt: str, model: str = "mistral"):
    # AI analyzes request and returns structured workflow requirements
    return {
        "feasible": True,
        "workflow_type": "schedule",
        "nodes_required": ["scheduleTrigger", "httpRequest", "if", "discord"],
        "schedule": {"interval": "5 minutes"},
        "parameters": {"url": "https://google.com", "discord_webhook": "..."}
    }
```

#### 2. Workflow Generation
```python
# Converts AI analysis into n8n workflow configuration
def build_ai_workflow(name: str, description: str, requirements: Dict):
    config = WorkflowConfig(name=name, nodes=[], connections={})
    
    # Add trigger node
    if requirements["trigger"] == "schedule":
        config.nodes.append(create_schedule_trigger(requirements["schedule"]))
    
    # Add action nodes based on requirements
    for action in requirements["actions"]:
        config.nodes.append(create_action_node(action))
    
    return config
```

#### 3. n8n Integration
```python
# Creates workflow in n8n via REST API
def create_workflow(workflow_config: Dict) -> Dict:
    response = requests.post(
        f"{self.base_url}/api/v1/workflows",
        json=workflow_config,
        auth=HTTPBasicAuth(self.username, self.password)
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Workflow Templates

The system includes predefined templates for common automation scenarios:

- **`weather_monitor`** - Scheduled weather data fetching with notifications
- **`web_scraper`** - Periodic website data extraction
- **`slack_notification`** - Slack message automation
- **`email_automation`** - Email sending workflows  
- **`http_api`** - HTTP API integration workflows
- **`webhook_receiver`** - Webhook handling workflows

### Design Decisions

#### Why We Built It This Way

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Separates concerns between AI processing, workflow building, and n8n communication
2. **Template-Based Approach**: Provides reliable, tested workflow patterns while allowing custom generation
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Enables natural language input without rigid syntax requirements
4. **Database Tracking**: Maintains audit trail and allows workflow management
5. **Docker Network Integration**: Seamless communication between services in containerized environment

#### Browser-to-Docker Network Pattern
Since browsers cannot access Docker internal networks, we use a proxy pattern:
```
Browser → Next.js Route → Python Backend → n8n Service
```

### Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL to track workflows and automation history:

```sql
-- Workflow records
CREATE TABLE n8n_workflows (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    prompt TEXT,
    template_id VARCHAR(100),
    config JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'created',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Automation history
CREATE TABLE n8n_automation_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT NOT NULL,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(255),
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT,
    execution_time FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Future Possibilities

#### Short-term Enhancements
- **Visual Workflow Preview**: Generate workflow diagrams before creation

## Authentication & Database

### Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL** with connection pooling
- **Users table** with JWT authentication
- **Environment-based configuration** for secure connections

### Authentication Options
- **Current:** Frontend API routes (`/app/api/auth/`)
- **Recommended:** Backend-centric authentication for enhanced security
- **JWT tokens** with configurable expiration (default: 1 hour)
- **bcrypt password hashing** for secure credential storage

## Project Structure

- `front_end/hermes-desktop-ui/`: **The live frontend** — the Hermes desktop UI (React + Vite). Built
  to a static bundle and served by Nginx at `/`. Harvis-specific code is under `src/plugins/harvis/`,
  `src/app/sign-in/` and `src/lib/harvis-session.ts`.
- `front_end/owui/`: Retired OpenWebUI fork, kept for reference only. Not built or served.
- `front_end/newjfrontend/`: Legacy Next.js frontend — vestigial (Nginx only proxies `/api/ai-chat`
  to it, and the live UI never calls that route). Slated for removal.
- `front_end/open-notebook/`: Vendored NotebookLM-style Next.js UI, served at `/onb`.
- `python_back_end/`: The main Python backend — FastAPI server, AI logic, orchestration, automation.
  - `research/`: Web search and research functionality
  - `ollama_cli/vibe_agent.py`: AI-powered development environment
- `rest_api/`: A separate FastAPI service.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the entire application.
- `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for routing traffic to the frontend and backend services.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipeline definitions for automated testing and deployment.

## Development Workflow

### Frontend Development (Hermes — the live UI)
> First-time deploy needs none of this — `docker compose up --build` builds the Hermes
> bundle inside Docker (the `hermes-ui-builder` service) and Nginx waits for it. To publish a
> UI change on a running install:
```bash
HARVIS_HERMES_UI_NODE_HEAP_MB=6144 docker compose build hermes-ui-builder
docker compose up hermes-ui-builder
docker restart nginx-proxy
```
For a fast edit loop: `cd front_end/hermes-desktop-ui && npm install`, then
`npx vitest run --project ui <paths>` and `npx tsc --noEmit -p .`.

### Docker Operations
```bash
docker compose up --build -d     # Build and run the entire stack (Nginx at :9000)
docker compose down              # Stop all services
docker compose logs -f [service] # View service logs
docker restart harvis-backend    # Backend is bind-mounted — restart to pick up Python changes
```

### Key Development Commands
- **Type checking:** `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` in `front_end/hermes-desktop-ui` before committing UI changes.
- **Backend tests:** `docker exec harvis-backend python -m pytest tests/ -q`.
- **Git strategy:** Feature branches from `main` with conventional commits.

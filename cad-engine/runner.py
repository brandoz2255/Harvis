"""Subprocess supervisor — the part of Gate 1B that can actually stop a build.

Gate 1A made bad input cheap to reject. It did nothing about work that has already
started: OCP holds the GIL through native OpenCascade calls, `concurrent.futures`
cannot cancel a future that has begun, and an HTTP disconnect propagates nothing.
A `timeout=` parameter bolted onto the old in-process path would have returned a
response while the geometry kept running and kept its slot. That is a lie, and this
module exists so we do not have to tell it.

The mechanism is a process, not a thread. Each build is a child started with
``start_new_session=True``, which makes it a process-group leader whose pgid equals
its pid. Killing the *group* rather than the child is the point: OCCT does not
fork today, but an importer or an exporter that shells out tomorrow would leave an
orphan behind, and that orphan would keep burning the CPU the container is capped at.

Honest limits of this kill path:

* Between the moment the direct child is reaped and the moment we signal the group,
  a PID-reuse window exists in theory. We reap last and signal the group first,
  which keeps the window closed in practice, but it is not a proof.
* A process stopped in an uninterruptible kernel wait (``D`` state) cannot be killed
  by anything, ``SIGKILL`` included. :func:`group_members` reports it, and the caller
  learns about it rather than being told the group is clear.

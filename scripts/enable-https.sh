#
# Why you want this: browsers hand out the microphone, the camera and the
# clipboard only to a "secure context". http://localhost counts as one, which is
# why the mic works on the machine running Docker and fails on every phone,
# laptop and tablet on the same network — those reach Harvis at
# http://<ip>:9000, which does not. Serving the same app over HTTPS fixes it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/enable-https.sh                 # cert for this machine's LAN address
#   ./scripts/enable-https.sh harvis.local    # plus an extra hostname or IP
#   ./scripts/enable-https.sh 192.168.1.50 harvis.local
#
# The certificate is self-signed, so the first visit shows a browser warning.
# That is expected and it is not a failure: click through once ("Advanced" ->
# "Proceed"), and the connection is encrypted and counts as secure from then on.
# For a warning-free certificate you need a real domain name and a public CA,
# which most home installs do not have.

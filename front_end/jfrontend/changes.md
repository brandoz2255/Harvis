## 2025-07-22 - Dynamic Model Selection for AI Agents

### Problem Description
The AI agents page only supported the hardcoded "mistral" model for n8n workflow automation. Users couldn't dynamically select different AI models (Ollama models, Gemini, etc.) for workflow generation.

### Root Cause Analysis  
- Frontend API route (`/api/n8n-automation/route.ts`) was bypassing the sophisticated Python backend
- The route made direct calls to Ollama with hardcoded "mistral" model
- Python backend already had full dynamic model support but wasn't being utilized
- AI agents page lacked model selection UI component

### Solution Applied
1. **Added Model Selector Component** to AI agents page (`app/ai-agents/page.tsx`):
   - Imported `useAIOrchestrator` hook for model management
   - Added model selection state (`selectedModel`) 
   - Implemented dropdown with Auto-Select, Built-in models, and Ollama models
   - Added model refresh functionality
   - Updated automation functions to pass selected model parameter

2. **Updated Frontend API Route** (`app/api/n8n-automation/route.ts`):
   - Replaced direct Ollama calls with Python backend proxy
   - Now forwards requests to `${BACKEND_URL}/api/n8n/automate`
   - Passes model parameter from frontend to backend
   - Proper error handling and response forwarding
   - Reduced code complexity from 199 lines to 41 lines

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Model selection persists during workflow creation
   - Visual indicator shows which model is being used
   - Refresh button to update available Ollama models
   - Graceful fallback to "mistral" when "auto" is selected

### Files Modified
- `front_end/jfrontend/app/ai-agents/page.tsx` - Added model selector UI and state management
- `front_end/jfrontend/app/api/n8n-automation/route.ts` - Simplified to proxy requests to Python backend

### Result/Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - AI agents page now supports dynamic model selection
- Users can choose between Auto-Select, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Mistral, and any available Ollama models
- Backend Python automation service already supported dynamic models - no backend changes required
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- Full integration with existing model management infrastructure
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding new model selection capabilities

### Technical Benefits
- Leverages existing Python backend's sophisticated n8n automation logic
- Utilizes existing model management and Ollama integration
- Reduces frontend complexity and maintenance burden  
- Provides consistent model selection experience across the application
- Supports future model additions without code changes

# NFS StorageClass - kept for reference but not actively used
# The artifact and audio PVCs have been converted to use local-path storage
# instead of NFS to avoid NFS server dependencies.
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: nfs-shared
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: harvis-ai
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner  # Manual provisioning
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
reclaimPolicy: Retain

# NOTE: All NFS PVs have been removed.
# The following PVCs now use standard ReadWriteOnce storage:
# - harvis-artifacts-pvc (in artifact-storage.yaml)
# - harvis-audio-pvc (in audio-storage.yaml)
# - ml-models-cache (in pvcs.yaml)
# - ollama-model-cache (in pvcs.yaml)
# 
# This StorageClass is kept for backward compatibility only.

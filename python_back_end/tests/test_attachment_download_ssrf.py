"""Gate 8A — the text-inlining fetcher cannot be pointed at internal services.

`_download_text_attachment` takes a URL straight off a client-supplied attachment
and inlines the response body into the model's context. Before this it was a
plain `httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)`, which made it a read primitive for
anything the backend can reach — the Ollama admin API, Postgres' port, a cloud
metadata endpoint — with the answer delivered back to the caller inside their own
agent transcript.

These tests assert the two rules that close it, and assert them the only way that
proves anything: by failing if a socket is opened at all. A test that merely
checks the return is None would pass on a network error and tell us nothing.

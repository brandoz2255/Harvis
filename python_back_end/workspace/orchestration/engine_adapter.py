"""External code-engine adapter (Phase E1 + E2) — run an EXTERNAL coding CLI against a
VibeCode session clone and stream its work back as the standard ``OpenClawEvent`` stream
+ a git diff, alongside the native ``vibecode-turn`` runner.

Engines (``engine=…``):
- ``opencode``    — local Ollama, no auth (E1).
- ``codex``       — OpenAI's Codex CLI, CLOUD GPT models, per-user OpenAI key (E2).
- ``claude-code`` — Anthropic's Claude Code CLI, CLOUD Claude models, per-user key (E2).
- ``kimi-code``   — the SAME Claude Code CLI + sidecar with ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL repointed at
  the Kimi Code membership API, per-user verified membership key.

Each runs in its own ``harvis-<engine>`` sidecar via ``docker exec`` against the session
clone (shared ``/data/artifacts`` volume). Per-engine differences are isolated to a
**command builder** (`_build_*_command`) and an **output mapper** (`_map_*_line`); the
loop (read NDJSON → map → persist/broadcast), diff collection, timeout, per-run cancel,
and path-safety are SHARED.

CLOUD engines: the user's decrypted API key is injected per-exec (`docker exec -e KEY=…`)
— NEVER baked in the image and NEVER logged. CLONE (``session``) isolation ONLY (the
caller enforces this); the clone diff is the only gate.

        files it never wrote, the fix is another invocation against the same clone. The
        accumulators are deliberately NOT reset — tool calls and billed tokens are the
        turn's totals across every round — but the per-attempt outcome fields are, or a
        repair round would inherit the first attempt's error and report a fixed workspace
        as broken.

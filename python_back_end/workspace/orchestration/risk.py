"""Per-action risk classification + the approval gate for in-place VibeCode sessions.

The permission ladder (per session): plan | ask | auto-accept | full-auto. Each tool
action gets a risk tier (low | med | high); the rung maps (tier → decision):

    rung          low      med      high
    plan          allow    block    block      (read-only — writes are refused)
    ask           allow    gate     gate
    auto-accept   allow    allow    gate       (the irreversible acknowledge-popup)
    full-auto     allow    allow    allow
    agent         allow    allow    allow      (+ a fourth tier, see below)

Agent teammates add one tier above 'high': ``hard`` — the four actions a
teammate must never take on its own (sign in, pay, send, delete). The 'agent'
rung exists because a teammate works in a throwaway clone with its own browser
profile, so the ordinary high-tier commands (a `>` redirect, `mv`, `rm -rf`)
are not destructive there and stopping on them would make the teammate stall
constantly. What it may never do unsupervised is act outward — that is the
``hard`` tier, and it gates under every rung. A hard limit the user has
cleared is downgraded by the caller BEFORE the ladder sees it, so there is no
'agent-override' rung: an override changes whether the agent keeps going, not
what it is allowed to do.

The runner consults ``gate_decision`` before every tool dispatch; on 'gate' it emits an
``approval_request`` event and blocks on an asyncio.Event until the UI resolves it
(``resolve_action``). In-memory + single-process, matching the rest of the orchestration
layer (clone-mode + the orchestrator never set permission_mode, so they're unaffected).

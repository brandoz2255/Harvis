"""Provider-aware routing for the native tool loop.

``model_proxy._resolve_route`` is the OpenClaw-era resolver, and it is
deliberately model-name-oblivious: the moment an ``openclaw_llm_config`` row
exists it posts EVERY model to that one provider URL with that one global key.
That is correct for the OpenClaw workspace, which really does have a single
configured engine — but it means the native ``SubAgentRunner`` could only ever
reach local Ollama plus whatever env keys the process happened to hold. The five
free-tier providers, the OpenAI catalog and Moonshot all keep their credentials
per-user in the database, so from the tool lane they were simply unreachable.

This module closes that gap for every provider that speaks OpenAI Chat
Completions. ``resolve_tool_route`` looks the model id up in the SAME registries
the chat lane uses (``free_providers.FREE_PROVIDERS``, ``cloud_chat``'s OpenAI
and Moonshot catalogs) and resolves the SAME per-user credential, so a key that
works in chat works in an agent run without being entered twice.

Returning ``None`` is the normal answer, not a failure: a bare Ollama tag has no
provider prefix and belongs to ``_resolve_route``. The caller falls through
unchanged, which is what keeps the native lane behaving exactly as before.

**Deliberately not covered: ``anthropic/*`` and ``kimi-code/*``.** Both speak the
Anthropic Messages wire format rather than OpenAI's, and both already drive their
OWN agentic tool-loop through the ``claude -p`` sidecar (see
``engine_adapter.run_claude_chat_workspace``). Handing them Harvis's tool schema
would mean translating two wire formats in order to give a CLI a second, worse
set of tools than the one it ships with.

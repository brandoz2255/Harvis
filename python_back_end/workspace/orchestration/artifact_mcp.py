"""A brokered file-delivery tool for sidecar engines: ``POST /api/workspace/artifact-mcp``.

An auto-launched Claude/Kimi sidecar runs read-only (see the ``--disallowedTools``
list in :mod:`engine_adapter`), so it cannot call ``Write``. That is the correct
posture for a run the user never explicitly asked for — but it also meant a model
asked to "make a 3D model in an HTML page" composed the whole page and then had no
way to hand it over. The run finished with zero artifacts and the UI had no Preview
button to offer, because there was nothing to preview.

This module is the narrow door that fixes that without reopening ``Write``. The
model does not get a filesystem; it gets one tool that accepts a *name*, *content*
and a *media type*, and Harvis decides what that turns into. The backend has no
mount of the sidecar's scratch volume at all, so the delivered bytes go straight
into ``workspace_artifacts`` — which is where the Artifacts tab, the Preview button
and the download endpoints already read from.

That has a pleasant consequence for the threat model: **there is no path on any
filesystem to traverse.** ``relative_path`` is a label on a database row, not a
destination. The rules below (no absolute paths, no ``..``, no hidden segments, a
bounded depth, an extension allowlist) are still enforced, because the label is
shown to a human and used to pick a renderer — but a bug in them cannot escape a
directory, because no directory is ever opened.

What the rules do carry weight for:

* **No overwrite.** A ``path`` already delivered by this run is refused rather than
  replaced, so a second call cannot quietly rewrite the artifact a user already
  opened.
* **Quotas.** A bounded file count and total size per run, so a loop that keeps
  calling this tool fills a quota instead of a disk.
* **Text only.** ``content`` is a string. Nothing here accepts base64 or bytes, so
  this tool cannot be used to smuggle an executable into the artifact store.
* **Identity is injected, never claimed.** The run this writes to comes from a
  server-signed header written at launch, exactly like the CAD context header. The
  model cannot name a workspace, and the bearer token is scoped to one user.

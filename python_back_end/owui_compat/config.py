"""OWUI ``GET /api/config`` payload — the boot-critical feature-flag matrix.

OpenWebUI's frontend fetches ``/api/config`` before it renders anything; if the
call fails it redirects to ``/error``. The frontend gates UI affordances on the
``features`` flags below — anything left ``False`` means OWUI hides that
affordance and never calls the backend route behind it, which keeps the v1
facade surface tight.

The single most important flag here is ``enable_websocket: False`` — it tells
OWUI's frontend to skip the Socket.IO connection so the (patched) chat path
streams tokens over HTTP SSE instead. See ``owui_compat`` package docstring.

    can say which side of the wire speaks, without a second round-trip.

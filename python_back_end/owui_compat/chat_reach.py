"""Read-only reach loop for PLAIN chat — live facts without a workspace run.

Agent Reach lives in the native workspace runner, so until now a question the
model could not possibly answer ("what's the current X?") got answered from the
weight file, confidently and wrong, while the tools that could have checked sat
one lane over. Launching a whole workspace for a one-line question is the wrong
shape: it costs a run card, a sandbox and a planner for what should be a couple
of seconds of fetching.

This module does the small version. Before the chat answers, when the turn needs
information the model cannot have (``reach_gate.verdict``) or the user turned on
Force Web Search in the + menu, it runs a short corrective retrieval loop:

  1. search the derived query and read the top hits concurrently — no model call,
  2. GRADE what came back: nothing at all, the wrong subject, or pages that do
     not actually contain what was asked (``_grade``),
  3. on a bad grade, REPAIR the query to match the failure — widen a search that
     returned nothing, pin the entity in quotes when the wrong things came back,
     and only if neither applies, spend one model call to rewrite it — then go
     back to 1, up to ``_MAX_RAG_ROUNDS`` (``_FORCED_ROUNDS`` when forced),
  4. if it is still short, let the model spend up to ``_MAX_MODEL_ROUNDS`` turns
     with two read-only tools (``web_search``, ``web_read``) to pick a specific
     result out of the list and read it,
  5. inject what it found — with its source URLs — as a context block on the
     last user message, saying so when the search never got there.

That is the self-correcting part, and the reason it is a loop rather than one
shot: a single search either works or it doesn't, and when it doesn't the old
code had exactly one move left. Grading names *how* it failed, and each failure
has a different repair. Every exit path returns the best set gathered so far, so
the loop can only add to what one search would have produced.

Step 1 goes first on measured latency, not taste: on the reference question it
cost 4.6s and answered it, while one model round cost 10.3s and produced no tool
call at all on qwen3:4b. The search engine has already done the ranking; asking a
small model to re-derive the same two URLs is the expensive way to get there —
which is also why the query repairs above are tried in that same order, cheapest
and most deterministic first.

Then the normal streaming answer runs, unchanged, on whichever lane the user's
model belongs to. That ordering is the whole design: because the result is
injected *text*, this works identically on the native router, the cloud-Claude
lane, and Hermes, none of which share a tool-calling implementation.

Everything here is read-only. There is no exec, no write, no edit — the worst a
prompt-injected page can do is put words in a context block the model is told to
treat as untrusted source material.

Failure is never fatal: any error leaves the body untouched and the chat answers
as it did before. Step 1 also stands on its own, so if the model round-trips fail
(no OpenAI-compatible route for the picked model, an HTTP error) the user still
gets search-grounded context rather than nothing.

    ``context`` is empty when nothing usable was found — the caller then injects
    nothing at all rather than an empty "here are your sources" block.

    ``query`` is what actually gets searched; ``message`` stays the user's turn
    and is only shown to the model. They used to be the same string, and that
    was the whole bug: "use a web search if you dont know anything" was typed
    into a search engine verbatim and came back with a 2010 blog post whose
    title contained that phrase, a Pinterest board, and India's eCourts portal.
    The turn the user actually wanted answered was the one before it.

    The loop is search → read → grade → repair the query → search again, up to
    ``_MAX_RAG_ROUNDS`` (``_FORCED_ROUNDS`` when the user asked for the search
    outright). It stops the moment the pages it has actually answer the
    question, and every exit — a good grade, a clock, no repair left to try —
    returns the best set gathered so far. That last part is not a detail: this
    runs in front of an answer the user is waiting on, so a loop that could come
    back with less than one search would be a downgrade, not an improvement.

    ``deadline`` is a ``time.monotonic()`` stamp; the default is the pre-answer
    budget so no caller (the hedge rescue passed none) can run unbounded. It is
    a soft limit — the loop checks it between rounds and hands each step only
    the time left — plus a hard stop ``_GRACE_S`` later that cancels the round
    in flight. Neither throws anything away: results and pages are written into
    shared state as they arrive, and a cancelled loop is composed from that
    state with a note that the search ran out of time.

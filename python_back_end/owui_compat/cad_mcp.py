"""The CAD tool surface as an authenticated MCP server: ``POST /api/cad/mcp``.

Claude Code and Kimi Code are sidecars. They do not run inside a Harvis chat turn,
so they cannot be handed native tool definitions the way the chat lanes are — they
speak MCP, and MCP is the only door they have. This module is that door, and it is
the *same tool set* as the native lanes: ``cad_tools.mcp_tools()`` and
``cad_tools.dispatch`` are shared, so there is exactly one implementation and one
place where the ownership rules live.

**Identity comes from the request, never from the payload.** The user id is read
off the JWT by the same dependency every other Harvis route uses and placed in the
``CadToolContext`` server-side. A sidecar can name a project id; it cannot name a
user, a storage key, or a path — ``dispatch`` refuses those arguments outright, and
every store read is scoped to the authenticated caller. That is what makes an MCP
surface safe to expose to a process running with a developer's shell.

This is a **stateless HTTP JSON-RPC** endpoint, not the stdio transport: one POST
carries one request and gets one response. There is no session to hijack and
nothing is kept between calls, so a dropped connection loses a call rather than a
conversation. ``initialize`` is answered for conformance — clients send it first —
but the server holds no state as a result.

    it as its own mistake, so a deployment without CAD should register nothing at all.

    The token is minted per run and scoped to one user by the same signer the rest of
    ``/api`` verifies against. It travels in the command line, like the model
    credential three lines above it in every launch site — the alternative, a config
    file in the shared artifact volume, would leave the token on disk after the run
    instead of dying with the process.

    **The context header is why a sidecar-authored part can be graded honestly.** A
    sidecar has no way to know the conversation it belongs to or what the person
    actually typed, so without this those arrive — if at all — as ``_meta`` the model
    itself wrote, and the DesignSpec would be extracted from the model's retelling of
    the request. Putting them here makes them exactly as trustworthy as the bearer
    token they sit next to: both are written by Harvis into one launch, and a process
    that could forge one could equally have stolen the other. The model is never asked
    for them and there is no tool that accepts them.

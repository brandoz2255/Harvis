"""Cron scheduler — single-tick loop body.

This module ships the LOGIC for one tick (find due jobs, dispatch each,
record the run, compute the next next_run_at). The TICK LOOP RUNTIME
(60s background task on the gateway thread, à la Hermes
``cron/scheduler.py:tick``) is intentionally not wired here — it
needs an integration point with the FastAPI lifespan that we'll add
when a downstream phase actually needs scheduled jobs to fire in
production. Until then, the scheduler can be tick()'d manually from
tests or a future runtime task.

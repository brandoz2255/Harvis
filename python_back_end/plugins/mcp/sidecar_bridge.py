"""One MCP server that re-exposes a user's own connectors to a sidecar engine.

A Harvis run reaches its tools two different ways, and until now only one of
them could see what the user had connected. The native agent loop asks
:mod:`tool_bridge` for OpenAI-shaped tool entries. A sidecar engine — the
Claude Code CLI, Kimi Code — never enters that loop at all: it only sees the
MCP servers named in the single ``--mcp-config`` Harvis hands it at launch, and
that config listed exactly two Harvis-authored servers. So a model on the
subscription lane would say it had no Higgsfield tool, and it was right.

This module closes that by speaking MCP *outward* over the same JSON-RPC-over-
HTTP shape :mod:`owui_compat.cad_mcp` established, while speaking MCP *inward*
through the existing runtime. The sidecar sees one server, ``harvis``; behind
it sit every connector that user has enabled, whatever transport each uses.

**Why a bridge rather than handing the sidecar the vendor URL directly.** The
alternative was to write each remote server's endpoint and bearer token into
the CLI's ``--mcp-config`` argument. That puts a vendor OAuth token in the
container's argv where any process can read it off ``ps``, it cannot express a
stdio connector at all (those run as sandbox siblings, not URLs), and it would
need the launch path to become async so tokens could be refreshed. Here the
only credential that leaves the backend is a short-lived Harvis JWT for the
user who launched the run — exactly what the CAD door already ships — and
every vendor token stays where it was sealed.

**Naming.** Tool names are built here rather than borrowed from
``tool_bridge.wire_name`` because the budget is different: a client prefixes
what it receives with ``mcp__<server>__``, so a name that already carried
``mcp__`` would arrive doubled and blow the 64-character limit the Anthropic
API enforces. Ours are ``<server>__<tool>``, and the map back to the real tool
is built in the same request that listed it, so a truncated or sanitised name
is never guessed at.

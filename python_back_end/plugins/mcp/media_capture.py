"""Mirroring media an MCP connector produced into the run's own artifacts.

A connector that generates media hands back a URL on its own service — ComfyUI
answers ``http://harvis-comfyui:8188/view?filename=...``. That URL is perfectly
valid *inside* the Docker network and completely useless to the person reading
the chat: their browser has no DNS for a bare service name, so the link dies on
lookup and the picture or clip they just paid GPU time for is unviewable.

So the bytes are fetched here, on the side of the network that can actually
reach them, and saved as a normal run artifact. That does two jobs at once: the
link in the reply becomes ``/api/workspace/artifact/<id>/raw``, which is
same-origin and ownership-checked, and the file lands in the Artifacts rail
next to everything else the run produced — no new frontend, because the rail has
always previewed binary artifacts.

**Only unreachable hosts are mirrored.** A connector returning a public URL
(``https://cdn.example.com/x.png``) already works in a browser, and copying it
into our database would be pointless duplication. The test is deliberately
narrow: a hostname with no dot cannot be a public name, and loopback/private
addresses resolve in the browser but to the wrong machine.

This fetch only ever goes to addresses a browser could not use: it reaches the
server's own network by design. That is fine for the operator and for an admin, and
it is not fine for a stranger on a shared host, whose MCP server picks the URLs
(``http://169.254.169.254/x.png``, ``http://pgsql:5432/a.png``) and gets the bytes
back as an artifact. So for a guarded caller (``providers.url_guarded``: a non-admin
on a shared host) nothing is mirrored. The same caller could also name any run id in
the ``X-Harvis-Run`` header, so skipping the write closes that too. Nothing here
follows redirects, reads content types outside image/video/audio, or returns the
body to the model, and the fetch is capped in size, time and count.

"""Bridge between a user's MCP servers and the Harvis agent tool loop.

The loop in ``workspace/orchestration/tools.py`` deals in OpenAI-shaped tool
entries and a ``(output, ok)`` dispatch contract. This module translates MCP
in both directions and is the ONLY place the two vocabularies meet.

Tool names are namespaced ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` so an MCP server can never
shadow a built-in tool (a connector exposing its own ``read_file`` would
otherwise silently take over file reads), and so ``dispatch_tool`` can route
on the prefix alone without consulting the database first.

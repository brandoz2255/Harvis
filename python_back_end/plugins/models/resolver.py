"""Adaptive local-model resolver — no hardcoded model names anywhere.

Replaces the pattern:

    fast_model = _model_override or _FAST_MODEL or cfg.model_name or "qwen3.5-32k:latest"

with:

    fast_model = (
        _model_override or _FAST_MODEL or cfg.model_name
        or await resolve_default_local_model(pool=pool, user_id=uid)
    )

Lookup order (each step is best-effort; failures fall through):

  1. Per-user preference — most recent row in ``openclaw_llm_config`` for
     ``user_id``. This is what the /model Discord command and the Build
     model picker write when a user picks something. Cloud facade ids
     (``anthropic/…`` etc.) are skipped here in favour of the row's
     ``last_local_model_id`` — this function must return something Ollama
     can actually run.
  2. ``HARVIS_DEFAULT_LOCAL_MODEL`` env var — operator override that
     applies cluster-wide when no per-user preference exists.
  3. First model returned by Ollama's ``/api/tags`` — whatever's actually
     installed gets used. If you ``ollama rm`` the active default and
     pull something else, the next dispatch picks up the new one with
     no code change.

**Every candidate from steps 1-2 is verified against ``/api/tags`` before it
is returned**, and an uninstalled one falls through to the next step. The saved
preference outlives the models it names — a DB restored onto another box, a
tag that was ``ollama rm``'d, or a row carried into a fresh clone all leave a
pick nobody pulled. Returning it unverified is what turns "your saved model is
gone" into a 404 on every dispatch, which is indistinguishable from the feature
being broken. An EMPTY tag list means Ollama was unreachable, not that the
candidate is bad, so the candidate is honored rather than second-guessed on a
transient failure. The cost is one ``/api/tags`` call per resolution; that is a
container-local request on a model-selection path, not a per-token one.

Returns ``None`` only when Ollama has zero models AND no env override
AND no user preference. Callers should treat that as "agent cannot run
right now" and surface a clear error rather than substituting a string.

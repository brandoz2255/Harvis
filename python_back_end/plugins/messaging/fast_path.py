"""Fast-path bypass for the workspace agent.

The workspace agent is heavily prompted to "ALWAYS use tool calls" and
"Start your response with a tool call, not a text message" (see
openclaw_client.py:874+). That's the right behavior for tool-using
tasks ("write a script that…", "fetch <url> and summarize"), but it's
the WRONG behavior for chat-like questions ("what are your
capabilities?", "what's 2+2", "hi"). The agent confuses itself, emits
nothing, and the user sees the cryptic "produced no answer and did not
call any tools" fallback.

This module provides:

  * ``should_use_fast_path(text)`` — quick classifier. Short messages
    without obvious workspace signals get fast-pathed; longer / signal-
    heavy messages run the workspace task detector for a richer
    decision.

  * ``direct_llm_reply(prompt, *, ollama_url, model_name)`` — single
    Ollama call (no tools, no agent loop), returns the model's text.

  * ``record_synthetic_completed_run(...)`` — inserts a workspace_runs
    row with status='completed' and the fast-path reply as
    final_summary. The gateway sidecar's wait_for_terminal then
    immediately sees a terminal status and delivers the reply, with
    zero changes to the existing polling pipeline.

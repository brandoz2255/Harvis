    Strategy: always pull the user's most-recent N memories so the agent
    has personal context regardless of whether the query has literal
    overlap with stored content. When ``query`` is given AND has
    substring matches, those are prepended (deduped) so query-relevant
    items appear first. Result is capped at ``limit``.

    Without this fallback, queries like "what is my job" returned an
    empty block because ILIKE substring matching against
    "Currently working on the Hermes integration project" finds nothing
    — even though that memory is exactly the answer.

    Returns "" when:
      - pool is None
      - no provider activates
      - the user has zero memories
    Provider exceptions are swallowed; this is best-effort enrichment.

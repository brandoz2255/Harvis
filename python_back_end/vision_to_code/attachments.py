"""Turn user attachments into real multimodal image parts.

Before this module, an uploaded screenshot reached the model as a *line of text*
("1. shot.png — image/png — file_id=..."). A model with eyes never got to use
them: it was told an image existed and left to guess. This resolves the bytes and
builds the OpenAI-style content parts the chat APIs actually accept:

    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,..."}}

Same shape as ``tools/openclaw_proxy.py`` vision-query and the Kimi chat path, so
model_proxy's existing list-of-parts handling covers it with no changes.

Byte resolution is deliberately narrow. ``file_id`` reads the sidecar metadata
written by ``POST /api/uploads``; ``path`` must resolve inside IMAGES_DIR; ``url``
accepts inline ``data:`` URIs and, because the Discord bot is a real producer of
attachments, Discord's own CDN — nothing else. An arbitrary URL here would make
this an SSRF primitive reachable from any chat message.

Every attachment that cannot be turned into an image part yields a human-readable
skip reason instead of vanishing. Silent skipping is how "the model ignored my
screenshot" becomes indistinguishable from "the model never received it".

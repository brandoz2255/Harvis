✦ Based on the code in python_back_end/research/, here's the logic for how the LLM performs research:

  The process is split between two main files: research_agent.py and web_search.py.

  research_agent.py - The Brains of the Operation

  This file acts as the orchestrator. It defines a ResearchAgent that manages the research process from start to finish. Here's its workflow:

   1. Generates Search Queries: When you give it a topic, it first uses an LLM to generate a set of 3 optimized search queries. It tries to create queries that
      will find the most relevant and authoritative information.
   2. Searches the Web: It then uses a "search agent" (from the other file) to execute these queries.
   3. Analyzes the Results: It takes the search results, prepares them as context, and then uses an LLM to analyze the information.
   4. Provides an Answer: Finally, it generates a comprehensive analysis, citing the sources it used.

  This agent also has functions for:
   * Fact-checking: To verify a specific claim.
   * Comparative research: To compare multiple topics.

  It also includes a fallback system for the LLM, trying a cloud-based one first and then a local one if the cloud fails.

  web_search.py - The Search Tool

  This file provides the tools for actually searching the web. It has two different search agents:

   1. `WebSearchAgent`:
       * Uses the DuckDuckGo search engine.
       * Intelligently optimizes search queries by adding keywords for authoritative sources (like arxiv.org for AI topics or github.com for code).
       * Scores and filters search results to find the most relevant ones.
       * Can extract the full content from web pages using the newspaper library.

   2. `TavilySearchAgent`:
       * An alternative that uses the Tavily search API, which is a search engine built specifically for LLMs.
       * It can fall back to using the WebSearchAgent if the Tavily API is not available.

  How They Work Together

  The ResearchAgent is the "brains" and the WebSearchAgent or TavilySearchAgent is the "legs." The ResearchAgent decides what to look for, the search agent
  fetches the data, and then the ResearchAgent analyzes that data to give you an answer.

  In short, yes, this code defines the logic for the LLM to perform research by searching the web, analyzing the content, and synthesizing an answer.
